! SYNOPSIS

''lud''

! DESCRIPTION

''lud'' is an experimental implementation of an OpenUDC client.

It can be currently used to:

* create your identity for the OpenUDC web of trust (udid2)
* registering that identity for participating to the monetary
  community.

Before running ''lud'' you should have created your GnuPG (''gpg'')
key pair.

The program functions interactively and presents a menu to the user.

An Internet connection is required, for most of the functionality.
